## **EMERGENCY PROTOCOL BUTTON**

Add a permanent floating button visible on ALL pages:

```jsx
<button 
  className="emergency-protocol-btn"
  onClick={() => setShowEmergencyProtocol(true)}
>
  🚨 EMERGENCY PROTOCOL
</button>

// CSS for button
.emergency-protocol-btn {
  position: fixed;
  top: 20px;
  right: 20px;
  background: linear-gradient(135deg, #8B0000 0%, #FF0000 100%);
  color: white;
  padding: 15px 30px;
  font-size: 18px;
  font-weight: bold;
  border: 3px solid #FF0000;
  border-radius: 10px;
  cursor: pointer;
  z-index: 9999;
  box-shadow: 0 0 20px rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.5);
  animation: pulse 2s infinite;
}

@keyframes pulse {
  0%, 100% {
    box-shadow: 0 0 20px rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.5);
  }
  50% {
    box-shadow: 0 0 40px rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.9);
  }
}
```

When clicked, opens FULL-SCREEN modal with complete emergency protocol from the rules document.

---

## **VIOLATION TRACKING PAGE**

Create "Violation Log" page with:

- List of all violations this week
- Penalties owed vs completed
- Monthly violation count
- All-time violation stats
- Trending analysis
- [Log New Violation] button
- Violation history calendar

---

## **INTEGRATION IN EACH TASK MODAL**

Before main instructions in EVERY task modal, add a harsh reality section:

**Example for Wake Up task:**

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  HARSH REALITY:                                             │
│  Your competition woke up at 5 AM. You're already behind.   │
│  Every snooze is training yourself to break promises.        │
│  Stand up NOW or stay mediocre forever.                     │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Example for Cold Shower task:**

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  HARSH REALITY:                                             │
│  Warriors embrace discomfort. Civilians avoid it.            │
│  3 minutes of cold water is building the discipline you     │
│  need for everything else. No excuses.                      │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Example for Business Work task:**

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  HARSH REALITY:                                             │
│  Every hour you waste is $50 you didn't earn. Someone      │
│  else is building while you're scrolling. The market       │
│  doesn't care about your feelings. Execute or stay broke.   │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

---

## **VICTORY DECLARATIONS SYSTEM**

After completing any task, show aggressive victory message:

**Example after Wake Up:**
```
🔥 VICTORY: You dominated the first test of the day.
Most men lost this battle. You won. Momentum is yours.
```

**Example after Cold Shower:**
```
🔥 VICTORY: You chose discomfort over comfort.
Warriors are forged in cold water. You're getting stronger.
```

**Example after completing all daily tasks:**
```
🔥 PERFECT DAY ACHIEVED: You're 1% of men who execute daily.
Your competition is making excuses. You're making progress.
This is how champions are built. Repeat tomorrow.
```

---

## **MISSED TASK HARSH CONSEQUENCES**

When a task is marked incomplete or skipped:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  ⚠️ VIOLATION DETECTED                                      │
│                                                             │
│  Task missed: [Task Name]                                   │
│                                                             │
│  HARSH REALITY:                                             │
│  You broke your word to yourself. This is how mediocrity   │
│  starts. One skip becomes a pattern. Patterns become        │
│  identity. Right now, you're training yourself to be a     │
│  quitter.                                                   │
│                                                             │
│  IMMEDIATE CONSEQUENCES:                                    │
│  • Streak broken                                            │
│  • [X] burpees owed                                         │
│  • [X] XP lost                                              │
│  • Violation logged publicly                                │
│                                                             │
│  YOUR CHOICE:                                               │
│  [Complete Task Now] [Accept Violation]                     │
│                                                             │
│  Choose wisely. Your future self is watching.               │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
