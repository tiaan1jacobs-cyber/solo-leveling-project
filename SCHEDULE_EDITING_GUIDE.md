## **BEST PRACTICES**

### **1. Start With Defaults**
- Use the default schedule for a few days
- See what works and what doesn't
- Then customize based on experience

### **2. Be Realistic With Times**
- Don't overpack your schedule
- Leave buffer time between blocks
- Account for transitions

### **3. Consistent Block IDs**
- Use descriptive, lowercase names
- No spaces (use underscores)
- Examples: `wake`, `morning_workout`, `deep_work_1`

### **4. Use Block Types Wisely**
- Color-codes help you see schedule at a glance
- Group similar activities with same type
- DA blocks in red = easy to track

### **5. Add Descriptions**
- Brief but helpful
- Explain the "why" not the "what"
- Examples:
  - ❌ "Work on business"
  - ✅ "Focus time for client deliverables"

### **6. Order Matters**
- Schedule flows top to bottom by time
- Display order only matters if times are same
- Usually just set to 0

### **7. Test Before Committing**
- Try new schedule for a day
- See if times work
- Adjust as needed
- Don't be afraid to iterate
