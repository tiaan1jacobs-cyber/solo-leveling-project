```
═══════════════════════════════════════════════
        ATTENTION: SYSTEM COMPROMISE DETECTED
═══════════════════════════════════════════════

You are not scrolling by accident.

Your brain is running predictive loops. You know where this leads.
The next 5 minutes will not be worth the 5 hours of flatline.

SYSTEM CHECK:
• Your discipline is being measured RIGHT NOW
• Every man who built something real controlled this first
• This isn't recreation - this is circuit-burning
• You are downgrading your hardware

THE MATH:
500+ hours wasted. That's 3 full months of work. GONE.

YOUR COMPETITION:
While you're clicking, someone with your exact opportunities
is choosing differently. In 12 months, the gap will be too wide.

THINK:
Could you tell any man you respect about the last month
without embarrassment? That gap between who you claim
to be and who you are IS YOUR ENTIRE LIFE.

IMMEDIATE ACTION:
1. Stand up NOW
2. State aloud: 'Update: data received'
3. 20 push-ups OR 3-minute walk outside
4. Do NOT negotiate

CLOSE THIS. RESET. MOVE.

[Cannot close for: 60 seconds]
[Times opened this week: X]
```

**Features**:
